		<p>What is <span>Musane</span>?<br />
		<ans>It is an insanely awesome music player. Huh? Keep scrolling..</ans></p><br />
		<p>What's the problem?<br />
		<ans>
			Currently, the most used players are probably VLC or iTunes. Problem is, they aren't that powerful.
			In the sense, they cannot manage my <i>big</i> music library the way I want them to!
		</ans></p><br />
		<p>Solution?<br />
		<ans>
			<span>Musane.</span>
			Its a union of <a href="http://getmoviemonkey.com" target="_blank">MovieMonkey</a> and 
			<a href="http://dropbox.com" target="_blank">Dropbox</a>. ;-)
			Can you guess it?
		</ans></p><br />
		<p>Tell me how it works.<br />
		<ans>
			Every user is associated with a <span>Musane</span> account. The player is available for all OS's. (Windows, Linux, Mac, Android, iPhone).
			So let's say the user downloads the app for his Windows system. The moment he downloads it, he would be asked to connect to his account. (like Dropbox)
			Now, the app will automagically find and organize all the Music from his system "<i>properly</i>". Properly in the sense, the real proper.
			Your album names will no more be songs.pk or TamilMP3.com or any random shit! User will have the choice to sort based on all possible domains, viz., Genre, Album, Artists and so on..
			This is the best a player can do for me. (Ideas from MovieMonkey)
		</ans></p><br />
		<p>The best part is..<br />
		<ans>
			We takes this to the cloud! Now stop searching for your data cable and give way to a seamless and wireless sync! Unifying your music
			experience. Every <span>Musane</span> account will get a free 2GB cloud space and they can have their music library there. Same way,
			whatever device you have will have the same music library in proper sync with your master! We set pricings for more space.
		</ans></p><br />
		<p>Why a player? It can just be a music manager.<br />
		<ans>
			There is a difference. As a player, we have a big scope for expansion. For example, we can get all sorts of data
			like what genres a user listens to the most, when does he listen to what kind of songs.. whatever wild thoughts we have we can work on it.
		</ans></p><br />
		<p>Can we go further?<br />
		<ans>
			Of course. I see a <i>huge</i>, a really huge scope for further development. We could build a musical social network out of
			<span>Musane</span> as every user is associated to an online account. We can have updates online as to what he's listening currently.
			Connect to people listening to the same music at the same time. Identify tastes, moods based on data we get and cluster people.
			Possibilities are endless.
		</ans></p><br />
			<p>Fundamentally, is this a product that people will love?<br />
		<ans>
			I guess, this will be a good product and people will love it. I haven't gone deeper to think much on this. But this is really really
			important before we even start working on this. I only have one big drawback to share.
		</ans></p><br />
		<p>The Drawback<br />
		<ans>
			The world is moving towards the concept of 100% Online music. That's the sole cause of Pandora's success. And now, to add on to it,
			Facebook has joined hands with services like Spotify, Rdio which are Pandora like services. I see this a big threat to <span>Musane.</span>
			The idea is really good that I don't wanna drop it at once. Let's discuss about ways to tackle this problem. It's well and good we are
			able to arrive at a solution.
		</ans></p><br />
			<p>Final Words<br />
		<ans>
			It's a very big project and if we decide to work on it, it'll be a great challenge!
